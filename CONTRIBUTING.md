# How to contribute

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Basic idea

* Fork codonPython on GitHub.
* Make a new branch for your contribution on that fork.
* Submit a pull request to codonPython.

Source + Doc + Test = :heart_eyes:

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to codonPython](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/pull/new/master) with a
clear description of what you have done.
We suggest you follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
Please do not send us undocumented code as we might not accept it. Including tests to your pull request brings tears of joy to our eyes.  

The easier it is for us to review a pull request, the faster we will merge it.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you will get an idea of it:

* We use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* We use docstrings and we try to (loosely) follow [`numpy`'s docstring standards](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard).
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
  
Thank you,
codonPeople
