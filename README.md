`codonPython` will reduce the entry barrier for analysis and provide software development experience for those at a higher level of technical ability. 

## Why `codonPython`?

Transparency 
  * To aline with government data principles and build public trust.

Improve Code 
  *	To innovate and improve the code we use and provide.

Usability 
  *	Increase the accessibility and uniformity of code throughout the organisation.

Cost Effective
  *	Reusable 'generalised' code will increase efficient in creating higher level processes. 

## Usage and Best Practices 
codonPython is open to contributions and developments from new and experience users. Below is information about best practices when using Github, contributing code and useful information for new users. 

### Instillation 
Clone a local repository to your machine from the remote repository using GitBash/Command Line.
```r
$ cd <landing_folder_for_local_repo>
```
1. `$ cd` - Entered into GitBash changes the directory to desired landing folder.
```r
$ git clone "https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython.git"
```
2. Copy/Paste the above into GitBash to clone repo to your local machine.
```r
$ cd <local_repo_name>
```
3. Change the root to the local repository.

### Checkout a branch using command line 
Once the repository has been cloned to your local machine complete the following steps to navigate the branches.
```r

## What is `codon`?

`Codon` is a project working towards creating a code repository to increase code sharing, consistancy and collaboration. The repository contains Python, R and SQL code for ease of use in workflows on platforms such as data bricks. Further information can be found [here.](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/Codon+-+Code+sharing)

#### Why `codon`?
**Transparency**: To aline with government data principles and build public trust.

**Improve Code**: To innovate and improve the code we use and provide.

**Usability**: Increase the accessibility and uniformity of code throughout the organisation.

**Cost Effective**: Reusable 'generalised' code will increase efficient in creating higher level processes.

## Contributing to codonPython
All new contributions codon are welcome, please follow the Coding Conventions in the [guidance document.](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidance. 
Any improvements to documentaion, bug fixes or general code enhancments are also welcomed. If a bug is found on the master branch please use the GitHub guidance on raising and [issue.](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

## New to GitHub?
GitHub is a hosting site that allows for development and version control of software using Git. It allows users to edit and develop parts of code independently before submitting back to the master code, whilst using version control to track changes. Begginers introductionary videos to GitHub can be found [here.](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/GitHub+for+beginners) Quick links to begginer guidance can be found below;
