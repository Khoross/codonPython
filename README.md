`codonPython` will reduce the entry barrier for analysis and provide software development experience for those at a higher level of technical ability. 

## Why `codonPython`?

Transparency 
  * To aline with government data principles and build public trust.

Improve Code 
  *	To innovate and improve the code we use and provide.

Usability 
  *	Increase the accessibility and uniformity of code throughout the organisation.

Cost Effective
  *	Reusable 'generalised' code will increase efficient in creating higher level processes. 

## Usage and Best Practices 
codonPython is open to contributions and developments from new and experience users. Below is information about best practices when using Github, contributing code and useful information for new users. 

### Instillation 
Clone a local repository to your machine from the remote repository using GitBash/Command Line.
```r
$ cd <landing_folder_for_local_repo>
```
1. `$ cd` - Entered into GitBash changes the directory to desired landing folder.
```r
$ git clone "https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython.git"
```
2. Copy/Paste the above into GitBash to clone repo to your local machine.
```r
$ cd <local_repo_name>
```
3. Change the root to the local repository.

### Checkout a branch using command line 
Once the repository has been cloned to your local machine complete the following steps to navigate the branches.
```r
$ git branch -a
```
1. List all the available branches
```r
*master
remotes/origin/<feature_branch_1>
remotes/origin/master
remotes/origin/<feature_branch_2>
```
All availabe branches will be listed. Using the branch names as a reference to navigate and checkout the desired branch. 
```r
$ git checkout <feature_branch>
```
2. Checkout the branch that you want to use.
```r
$ git checkout -b <feature_branch>
```
3. Can also create a new branch if required.
```r
$ git branch
```
4. To confirm you are working on the correct branch.

## New to GitHub?

GitHub is a hosting site that allows for development and version control of software using Git. It allows users to take a piece of code ( a branch) edit/develop it and submit it back to the owner to the original copy ( the master branch), whilst keeping track of all changes that have been made along the way.
